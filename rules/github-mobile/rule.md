As a developer you're likely using GitHub all the time - it's one of the main repositories for code. When you're keeping a good work-life balance, it's not ideal for someone to be blocked by a pull request review that would take you 1 minute - just because you're out getting some fresh air.

Having GitHub on your mobile helpw you unblock people quickly, and leave comments all while you‚Äôre on the go. Devs are more productive [when they get regular breaks](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/pomodoro) - so why not review pull requests in the park!

### Why You Should Have GitHub on Your Phone

* **Unblock others** - Nothing is more frustrating for a developer than waiting hours or even days for a small PR approval or a comment on an issue

* **Stay updated** - It‚Äôs easier to fall behind on comments and issues if you‚Äôre only able to check GitHub from your computer.

* **[Get notifications](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/github-notifications/)**  GitHub's mobile app lets you control which notifications you receive

### GitHub Contributions Widget

Seeing your contributions can be a great motivator and helps you keep track of your activity. You can add the GitHub contributions widget to your phone‚Äôs home screen to view your recent contributions at a glance.
